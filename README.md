# cloud-infrastructure-azure
Cloud infrastructure project for MultiSoftware Enterprise using Microsoft Azure. Created by our ,Univators, team for Spring 2025,at DIB UTh.

# Introduction 
This project involves the design and implementation of a fully cloud-native infrastructure for MultiSoftware Enterprise, a multinational software development company headquartered in Athens, Greece. With approximately 350 employees distributed across multiple regions, the company is adopting a cloud-first strategy by moving entirely to Microsoft Azure — without relying on any legacy or on-premises systems.

The goal of this project is to create a secure, resilient, and scalable environment that:

    Supports modern application development

    Ensures centralized identity and access control

    Provides secure data storage and global team collaboration

    Enables cost visibility, compliance, and operational efficiency from day one

Our team’s objective is to leverage core Azure services — including App Service, Azure SQL, Blob Storage, Entra ID, and Azure Monitor — to meet these needs. The solution is structured around infrastructure best practices and is deployed and documented in a way that is easily extensible and cost-effective.
